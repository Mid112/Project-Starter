> readers stay focused and encourage a better reading experience through a disciplined goal. The <br> 
> ability to record things like ranks, quotes and notes will be much better than scattered <br> 
> documentations. All readers will find it useful to explore their preference through genres they <br>

> tastes of individual readers. The book also promotes individual growth through increasing exposure to <br>
> different genres and setting a disciplined reading goals.
